While there are many objective ways to identify when the golden age of video games was, based on my analysis the early 1990's was the golden age of video games.
For both users and critics two years overlapped where the avg review score was in the top 10 where more than 20 games were released. Those years were 1990
and 1994. This means that there are plenty of other years where users or critics individually thought great games were release, however, these two years are years
where both critics and users agreed there were great video games.
